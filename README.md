# Oridata Stand for (Object Representation Interface Data)
Oridata is a fixed data that is capable of combining live calculations. It has to allow for embedded code, so that data can make its own calculations, decisions, or even change values when necessary. This will make Oridata the best option for applications that need data to be dynamic, flexible in real-time, and capable of changing on the fly.

### 1. Overview and Purpose

**Start with Purpose:** The data format can be defined as hierarchical, driven by data where Oridata stores more than static data: it supports evaluable code snippets. In this sense, therefore, Oridata is both a data store and a layer of functionality that can execute logic or calculations in place.

**Use Cases:** Explain scenarios where Oridata is beneficial. For example, configurations where computed values or dynamically generated content are needed, or complex data hierarchies that require flexibility.
