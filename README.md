# Oridata
Oridata is a layered data format that combines fixed data with live calculations. Unlike JSON, it supports embedded code, allowing data to perform calculations, make decisions, or change values dynamically. This makes Oridata ideal for applications needing flexible, real-time data that adapts on the fly.
